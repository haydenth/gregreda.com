Abstract: I talk about one of my favorite (and easiest) proofs - Cantor's proof that there is more than one infinity.

Since I wasn't a math undergrad, I didn't learn this proof until graduate school when I had to TA discrete math. It's still one of my favs because of it's simplicity and it blows my mind that between 400 BC, when man first started talking about infinity and this proof in the 19th century, we didn't know this.

Assumptions:

* We know the set of natural/counting numbers (0, 1, 2, ...) and we know these can go on infinitely
* We know about the rational numbers (ie fractions, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, ...) 
* We know about the real numbers (ie decimals, 0, 0.0001, ...)

See this post for my thoughts about these assumptions.

Thre are two claims here:

* There is a 1-1 mapping between the natural and the rational numbers. The "infinity" of the naturals is the same as the "infinity" of the rationals. This is surprising because intuitively it seems like the rationals would somehow be *bigger*. 
* There is *not* a 1-1 mapping between the natural and the real numbers. The "infinity" of the reals is bigger than the infinity of the natural numbers.

To me, that last point seems theoretically crazy. We can take the notion of infinity (already pretty crazy) and say, yeah, if we assume there exists this thing called real numbers, then that thing has MORE INFINITIES.

** Claim 1 - Infinity of Naturals = Infinity of Reals **

** Claim 2 - There are MORE INFINITIES **
This is a fun proof (by contradiction). Assume that the infinity of the natural numbers is the same as the real numbers. Therefore, there must be some kind of correspondence like:
\*
$$
\begin{eqnarray}
  1 & = & 0.109232 \\\\
  2 & = & 0.109233 \\\\
  3 & = & 0.170232 \\\\
  4 & = & 0.803290 \\\\
\end{eqnarray}
$$
