Abstract: I talk about one of my favorite (and easiest) proofs - Cantor's proof that there is more than one infinity.

Since I wasn't a math undergrad, I didn't learn this proof until graduate school when I TA'ed discrete math. It's still one of my favs because of it's simplicity and it blows my mind that between 400 BC, when man first started talking about infinity and this proof in the 19th century, we didn't know this.

Assumptions:

* We know the set of natural/counting numbers (0, 1, 2, ...) and we know these can go on infinitely
* We know about the rational numbers (ie fractions, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, ...) 
* We know about the real numbers (ie decimals, 0, 0.0001, ...)

I will make another post later with my crazy theoretical ramblings on these assumptions.

Infinity
===========
Take the counting numbers (1,2,3,4,..). Theoretically, these go on forever. If you drew a number line - there is no reason why or when these would ever stop. This is the fundamental notion of infinity. It's not a number, it's a measure of size.

We also know that any sequence that can be put in 1-1 correspondence with the counting numbers is considered an infinite sequence *of the same length* as the counting numbers. (Mathematicians say that the cardinality is the same).

For example, consider only the even numbers. This might seem like it should be smaller (by half!) than the counting numbers but infinity is crazy and it's actually *the same length*. There is no $\infinity \over 2$. Here's why, consider the 1-1 correspondence:

Some Proofs
==============
There are two claims here:

* There is a 1-1 mapping between the natural and the rational numbers. The "infinity" of the naturals is the same as the "infinity" of the rationals. This is surprising because intuitively it seems like the rationals would somehow be *bigger*. 
* There is *not* a 1-1 mapping between the natural and the real numbers. The "infinity" of the reals is bigger than the infinity of the natural numbers.

To me, that last point seems theoretically crazy. We can take the notion of infinity (already pretty crazy) and say, yeah, if we assume there exists this thing called real numbers, then that thing has MORE INFINITIES.

** Claim 1 - Infinity of Naturals = Infinity of Rational Fractions **

** Claim 2 - There are MORE INFINITIES **
This is a fun proof (by contradiction). Assume that the infinity of the natural numbers is the same as the real numbers. Therefore, there must be some kind of correspondence like:

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
  1 & = & 0.109232 \\\\
  2 & = & 0.109233 \\\\
  3 & = & 0.170232 \\\\
  4 & = & 0.803290 \\\\
\end{eqnarray}
$$
