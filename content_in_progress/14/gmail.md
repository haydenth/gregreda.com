Title: Personal Email Data Retention

Abstract: I talk about a personal data retention policy for emails. I have stuff in my inbox almost 10 years old and I want to archive in something closer to cold storage than gmail.

I may be crazy
------------------
I've been a gmail user since the service started -- I remember sitting in my room in college trolling the internet for people who could get me a code to join. I think I even joined Google's Orkut service at the time, in hopes that it would land me a registration code on gmail. So I've been using it as my primary email address for about 10 years now. I have about 13 gigs of email. Hardly big data!

Here's the deal: I don't really want to keep 10 years of emails around. Here's why:

* Compromised account - suppose my email was compromised. Do I really want to expose emails that are ten years old? Maybe these have tax returns or personal information from friends? Maybe I said some pretty dumb things when I was 22 years old.
* Everything is accessible - GMail is like a filing cabinet that is searchable. But there is content that is better suited to shoe boxes under the bed than filing cabinets. You don't want to encounter it frequently but you don't want to trash it either. 

I don't want to permanently delete them either. Maybe some day, I might want to go back and read some old emails, like you would letters in a shoebox under the bed. I'm not really convinced that humans (or maybe just me) are well equipped to handle instant access to their entire adult life's communications instantly.
